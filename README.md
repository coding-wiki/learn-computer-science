Learn the science of the computers...

This is for a more generic and abstract understanding of how computers work. Language-specific implementations of algorithms, etc, are likely to be in the corresponding `learn-$language` repositories.

# Notes
CS61 - https://cs61.seas.harvard.edu/wiki/2017/Prerequisites
- Write a "Hello world" program:
  ```c
  #include <iostream>
  
  int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello world!" << std::endl;
  }
  ```
- Write a function
- Declare a pointer variable
- Call malloc and free the malloc
- Define a structure
- Use typedef
- Be able to use the string functions (strcmp, strlen, strcat, strdup) correctly together with memory management
- Write a function that takes three arguments, a size and two objects, and exchanges the values of the two objects (each of which have the given size).
